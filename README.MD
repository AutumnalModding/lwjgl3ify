# LWJGL3ify

Brings LWJGL3 to Minecraft 1.7.10.

## Usage

To install in PrismLauncher (it might also work in MultiMC):

Copy the contents of `prism-libraries` to `instances/My Modpack/`. `mmc-pack.json` needs to be overwritten. Reload prismlauncher, and it should work.
Put the mod jar in `mods/` in your instance's minecraft folder.
Put the forge patches jar in `libraries/` in your instance folder.
